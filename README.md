## Installation
The `plugins/` folder can be dropped right into `PEAK/Bepinex/` (or the contents of `plugins/` can be moved into `PEAK/Bepinex/plugins/`, same thing.)

## Usage
Draws a component on the screen that shows characters' name and height.

### Settings
#### Includes it's own game settings Roster Tab for adjusting the roster how you like in real-time.
#### Adjust the mode, position, length, thickness, offset, font size and player limit.

### Positions
#### Left, Right, Top, Bottom.
The top and bottom bars will only show player markers, minimalizing the UI.  

### Modes
#### Full
See the full scale of the mountain. Things will look cramped climbing together with a group of friends, but gives a good view of your progress in total.
#### Centered
Shows a relative view of the scouts around you, with logarithmic scaling. That means it spreads out the people closest to you so you can see who the real surivalists are: anyone whose name is clumped up is forgetting Rule 0!
